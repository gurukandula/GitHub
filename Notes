Explanation
Session Management:
When a user logs in successfully, a session is created, and the username is stored in the session.
The home page (home.jsp) retrieves and displays the username from the session.
The logout functionality invalidates the session, effectively logging the user out and redirecting them to the login page.
This setup adds session handling to your JSP and servlet-based login system with Amazon DynamoDB as the backend

2. Setting Up Amazon DynamoDB
Create a DynamoDB Table:

Table Name: users
Primary Key: username (String)

username: user1
password: pass1
